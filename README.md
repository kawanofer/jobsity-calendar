# Jobsity - Front-end Javascript Challenge

## Description

This project is designed to test your knowledge of front-end web technologies and assess your ability to create front-end UI products with attention to details, cross-browser compatibility, standards, and reusability.

### Mandatory Features

- [x] Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also, include a city.
- [x] Display reminders on the calendar view in the correct time order.
- [x] Allow the user to select color when creating a reminder and display it appropriately.
- [ ] Ability to edit reminders – including changing text, city, day, time and color.
- [ ] Add a weather service call from a free API such as Open Weather Map, and get the weather forecast (ex. Rain) for the date of the calendar reminder based on the city.
- [ ] Unit test the functionality: Ability to add a new "reminder" (max 30 chars) for a user entered day and time. Also, include a city.

### Bonus (Optional)

- [ ] Expand the calendar to support more than the current month.
- [ ] Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.
- [x] Functionality to delete one or ALL the reminders for a specific day

### Considerations

- Redux (or any other state manager) structure of the calendar.
- [x] The project is totally focused on the front-end; please ignore the back-end.
- [x] Keep your code versioned with Git.
- [x] Feel free to use small helper libraries for:
-- UI Elements.
-- Date/Time handling.
- [x] You must create the calendar component yourself. Do not use calendar libraries like FullCalendar or Bootstrap Calendar.
- [ ] If you use an external API, make sure to provide working API keys.
